# Content-based-Movie-recommendation-System
My team and I have done the project as part of our curriculum at Columbia University in the City of New York. The project illustrates a movie recommendation engine using TMDb dataset. We have used three different models to perform content-based filtering.

Content-based filtering uses the characteristics of the items to find similarity between them, For instance, if a user watches a lot of sci-fi movies, he will be recommended another sci-fi movie because they are "similar". Here, I have outlined the process of data extraction, exploratory data analysis and the methods used to build the engine. The outcome is here for you to judge. Would love to hear your thoughts and comments - contact me by email!
